# 🎯 Stage 1: Number Recognition and Counting (1-10)

## 🌟 Learning Goals & Objectives

Hello little explorers and their families! I'm delighted to share our exciting journey into the world of numbers for our 3-year-olds at kindergarten. In Hong Kong, we believe learning should be like a fun adventure, full of discovery and hands-on play!

For our first stage, "Number Recognition and Counting (1-10)", we'll be playing, singing, and exploring to help our children build a strong foundation. Here are our detailed learning goals, presented in a way that's easy to understand and brimming with Hong Kong flavour:

**Stage 1: Number Recognition and Counting (1-10) - Learning Goals for Our 3-Year-Olds**

By the end of this stage, your child will be able to:

*   **1. Sing and Say Numbers 1-10 in Order (Rote Counting):**
    *   **What it looks like:** Children can happily recite numbers from 1 to 10, just like a catchy song! They might sing a Cantonese number rhyme (e.g., "Yat, Yi, Saam..." for 1, 2, 3) or count as we line up for a pretend MTR ride.
    *   **How we learn:** Through engaging songs, action rhymes, and repetitive counting during daily routines like snack time or tidying up. We'll clap, stomp, and make it a joyful group activity.

*   **2. Count Objects Up to 5 Accurately (One-to-One Correspondence):**
    *   **What it looks like:** When given a small group of items (initially up to 5, then progressing to 10), children can touch each item once and say one number name for each item to find the total. For example, counting "one, two, three" delicious dim sum pieces.
    *   **How we learn:** Hands-on activities are key! We'll count yummy egg tarts, colourful building blocks, toy MTR trains, or even their friends' fingers. We encourage them to touch each item as they count.

*   **3. Recognise and Name Numerals 1-5 (Visual Recognition):**
    *   **What it looks like:** Children can point to the written numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and say their names when they see them on flashcards, in books, or around our classroom. They might spot a '3' on a pretend bus ticket!
    *   **How we learn:** We'll use chunky number puzzles, sensory trays with sand to trace numbers, and "Number Hunt" games around the classroom, looking for numbers on different objects.

*   **4. Match Quantities to Numerals 1-5 (Quantity Recognition):**
    *   **What it looks like:** Children can connect a written number (like '4') to the correct group of objects (e.g., four colourful fishballs on a skewer).
    *   **How we learn:** We'll provide number cards and ask children to place the corresponding number of objects next to them, like putting two play-dough pineapple buns next to the number '2'. We also use matching games with pictures of Hong Kong landmarks or items.

*   **5. Understand "How Many?" and Respond with a Number:**
    *   **What it looks like:** When asked "How many?", children can count a small group of items and tell you the total number. For example, "How many red lanterns are hanging?" (child counts and says "Five!").
    *   **How we learn:** We'll integrate this into daily conversations and play. "How many friends are at the drawing table?" "How many steps did you climb to the slide?" This helps them see numbers as representing a quantity.
