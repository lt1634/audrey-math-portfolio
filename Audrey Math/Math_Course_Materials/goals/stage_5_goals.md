# Stage 5: Measurement and Comparison

## Learning Goals

Here are engaging, age-appropriate learning goals for 3-year-old children in a Hong Kong kindergarten, focusing on **Stage 5: Measurement and Comparison**.

---

**Theme:** Exploring "How Big," "How Long," and "How Heavy" Things Are!

**Overarching Idea:** Our little explorers will use their hands and eyes to compare everyday objects, learning to notice and talk about differences in size, length, and weight!

**Learning Goals for Our Little Explorers:**

1.  **Taller, Shorter, Longer!**
    *   **Goal:** Children will be able to compare two objects or people and use words like "taller," "shorter," "longer," and "shorter."
    *   **Let's Play & Explore:**
        *   "Look! Is Timmy *taller* than Lily today? Let's stand back-to-back and see!"
        *   "Which toy double-decker bus is *longer*? The red one or the green one? Let's line them up!"
        *   "At our pretend dim sum stall, which piece of noodle is the *longest*? Can you find the *shortest* one?"
    *   **Hands-on Fun:** Comparing children's heights, lining up toy MTR trains, measuring ribbons or toy chopsticks, seeing which piece of yarn reaches further.

2.  **Heavier, Lighter!**
    *   **Goal:** Children will be able to hold two objects and feel which one is "heavier" and which one is "lighter."
    *   **Let's Play & Explore:**
        *   "Which feels *heavier*? This big juicy pomelo or this tiny lychee? Let's hold one in each hand!"
        *   "Is this real egg tart *heavier* than our pretend clay one? Try holding them both!"
        *   "At the market, which basket of toy fruits feels *lighter*? The one with grapes or the one with a big pumpkin?"
    *   **Hands-on Fun:** Using a simple balance scale (or just their hands!) to compare a plastic fish with a toy crab, a small book with a feather, different fruits or small toys.

3.  **Bigger, Smaller!**
    *   **Goal:** Children will be able to compare two objects and use words like "bigger" and "smaller" to describe their overall size.
    *   **Let's Play & Explore:**
        *   "Wow, look at the big ferry and the small sampan in Victoria Harbour! Which one is *bigger*?"
        *   "Is your char siu bao *bigger* or *smaller* than my siu mai? Let's put them next to each other!"
        *   "Let's sort our red packets! Which one is the *biggest* for Grandma, and which is the *smallest* for our little cousin?"
    *   **Hands-on Fun:** Sorting blocks by size, comparing different sized leaves from the park, matching big and small animal toys, looking at different sizes of plastic wontons.

4.  **More, Less (Capacity)!**
    *   **Goal:** Children will begin to understand "more" and "less" when comparing amounts of liquid or sand in containers visually.
    *   **Let's Play & Explore:**
        *   "We're having yum cha! Which teacup has *more* water in it? This one or that one? Look closely!"
        *   "Let's fill our sand buckets. Who has *less* sand? You or me? Let's pour it out and see!"
        *   "Pouring soy sauce for our dumplings! Which little bowl has *more* sauce?"
    *   **Hands-on Fun:** Water play (pouring water between different sized cups), sand play (filling different containers with sand), comparing scoops of rice or beans.

5.  **Ordering Our Treasures (Early Sequencing)!**
    *   **Goal:** Children will begin to try and arrange 2 or 3 objects in order, such as from "biggest to smallest" or "longest to shortest," with guidance.
    *   **Let's Play & Explore:**
        *   "Can we line up these three toy MTR trains from the *longest* to the *shortest* one? Let's try together!"
        *   "Let's put our building blocks in order: *tallest* to *shortest*! Like our Hong Kong skyscrapers!"
        *   "We have three different sized oranges from the fruit stall. Can you put them in order from *biggest* to *smallest*?"
    *   **Hands-on Fun:** Arranging building blocks by height, lining up different sized nesting dolls or bowls, sorting playdough snakes by length.
