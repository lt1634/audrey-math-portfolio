### **Learning Goals: Shapes – Finding Our Shape Friends!**

By the end of this stage, our 3-year-old children will be encouraged to:

1.  **Be Shape Detectives (Recognizing & Naming Basic Shapes):**
    *   **Goal:** Recognize and begin to name three basic shapes: **circle**, **square**, and **triangle**.
    *   **How we learn:** "Let's find the **round circles** like a yummy **egg tart** or a **Hong Kong dollar coin**! Can you spot a **square window** on the MTR train or a **square biscuit**? And look, a **triangle roof** on a toy house!" We'll point them out, say their names, and touch them.
    *   **Hands-on Fun:** Playing with shape sorters, matching shape cut-outs, building with blocks.

2.  **Be Matching Masters (Matching Identical Shapes):**
    *   **Goal:** Match identical shapes from a small group.
    *   **How we learn:** "Can you give this **round circle plate** to its **circle friend** on the table? Let's match all the **square puzzle pieces** together!" We'll use two-piece puzzles or pairs of shape cards.
    *   **Hands-on Fun:** Shape matching games, pairing socks with shape patterns, putting lids on containers of the same shape.

3.  **Be Shape Hunters (Finding Shapes in the Environment):**
    *   **Goal:** Identify and point out basic shapes in everyday objects, both indoors and outdoors.
    *   **How we learn:** "Look around our classroom! What has a **square shape** like a building block? What's **round** like a clock? Can you see anything shaped like a **triangle** on our storybook cover?" We'll go on "shape hunts" inside and outside the classroom.
    *   **Hands-on Fun:** Walking around the school, pointing out shapes in toys, furniture, and pictures.

4.  **Be Shape Sorters (Sorting Objects by Shape):**
    *   **Goal:** Sort a small collection of objects into categories based on their shape (e.g., all circles together, all squares together).
    *   **How we learn:** "Time to clean up! Let's put all the **circle beads** in the red basket and all the **square blocks** in the blue basket! Good job being a shape sorter!"
    *   **Hands-on Fun:** Sorting various objects (buttons, blocks, cut-out shapes) into designated bins or trays.
