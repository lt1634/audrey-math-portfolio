# Stage 4: Basic Addition/Subtraction with Objects

## Learning Goals

Here are detailed learning goals for 3-year-old children in Hong Kong, focusing on Basic Addition/Subtraction with Objects, Stage 4 of their mathematical journey. We'll use simple language, familiar objects, and fun, hands-on activities to make learning enjoyable and relevant!

**Learning Goals for Stage 4: Basic Addition/Subtraction with Objects**
(For 3-year-olds)

Our little mathematicians are learning to put things together and take things away, just like magic! We'll use our hands, our toys, and yummy snacks to explore how numbers change.

### **A. Learning Goals for Basic Addition (Putting Things Together)**

Children will be able to:

1.  **Combine Small Groups:**
    *   **Goal:** Physically combine two very small groups of familiar objects (e.g., up to 3 objects in each group, total not exceeding 5) and count the total number.
    *   **Activity Idea:** "Let's put 2 yummy *siu mai* (pork dumplings) on this plate, and then add 1 more *siu mai* from here. How many *siu mai* do we have altogether for our pretend *yum cha* (dim sum tea)?"

2.  **Understand "One More":**
    *   **Goal:** Understand the concept of "one more" when an object is added to an existing small group (up to 4 objects).
    *   **Activity Idea:** "You have 3 colourful building blocks. Wow! Here's one more block. Now, how many blocks do you have?" (Encourage counting all blocks from the start.)

3.  **Use Fingers to Add:**
    *   **Goal:** Use their fingers to represent small quantities and combine them to find a total (e.g., show 2 fingers on one hand and 1 finger on the other, then count all 3 together).
    *   **Activity Idea:** "Can you show me 2 happy fingers on one hand? And 1 sleepy finger on the other hand? Now, put them all together! How many fingers are wiggling altogether?"

### **B. Learning Goals for Basic Subtraction (Taking Things Away)**

Children will be able to:

1.  **Remove Objects and Count Left:**
    *   **Goal:** Physically remove a small number of objects (1 or 2) from a group (starting with up to 5 objects) and count how many are remaining.
    *   **Activity Idea:** "We have 4 lovely red apples in our fruit basket. If I take away 1 apple to eat, how many apples are left in the basket?"

2.  **Understand "One Less":**
    *   **Goal:** Understand the concept of "taking one away" or "one less" from a small group.
    *   **Activity Idea:** "There are 3 little *fish balls* on our pretend skewer. Yum! If you eat 1 *fish ball*, how many *fish balls* are still on the skewer?"

3.  **Respond to "Take Away" Stories:**
    *   **Goal:** Respond to simple "take away" stories using familiar objects and scenarios, demonstrating the concept by counting.
    *   **Activity Idea:** "Look! We have 5 little toy pandas playing in the park. Oh no, 2 pandas went home for a nap! How many pandas are still playing in the park?" (Children remove 2 pandas and count the rest).
