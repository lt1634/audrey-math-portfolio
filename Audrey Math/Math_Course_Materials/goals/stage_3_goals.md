# Stage 3: Patterns and Classification

## Learning Goals

Here are the engaging, hands-on learning goals for our clever 3-year-olds, focusing on "Patterns and Classification" within the Hong Kong kindergarten curriculum! We'll make learning a fun adventure with familiar objects and scenarios.

### Learning Goals for Stage 3: Patterns and Classification (3-year-olds, Hong Kong Kindergarten)

**Overall Goal:** To develop early mathematical thinking through observing, recognizing, and organizing the world around them.

---

**A. Exploring Patterns (重複模式)**

Patterns help children understand order, sequence, and make predictions!

1.  **Recognizing Simple Patterns:**
    *   **Goal:** Children can point to and describe a simple repeating pattern (e.g., ABAB, AABB).
    *   **Fun Activity:** "Look, look! Red lantern, yellow lantern, red lantern, yellow lantern! Can you see the pattern? We can clap, stomp, clap, stomp, noticing the 'same, different' sounds!"
    *   **HK Element:** Using mini colourful lanterns or MTR train colors (e.g., Red Line train, Green Line train).

2.  **Continuing Patterns:**
    *   **Goal:** Children can extend a simple repeating pattern by adding the next element.
    *   **Fun Activity:** "Teacher has started a yummy pattern with our toy dim sum: 'Siu Mai, Har Gow, Siu Mai, Har Gow...' What comes next? You choose!" We'll also use colourful beads to string simple patterns for a necklace or bracelet.
    *   **HK Element:** Toy dim sum (siu mai, har gow), craft beads for simple traditional decorations.

3.  **Creating Own Patterns:**
    *   **Goal:** Children can create their own simple repeating patterns using various materials.
    *   **Fun Activity:** "Today, we're pattern artists! Use the red and green building blocks, or the different shaped leaves we found in the park. Can you make your own 'grow, grow, grow' pattern?"
    *   **HK Element:** Building blocks, natural materials from local parks, or even different colored Play-Doh "noodles" like those used in local street food.

**B. Classification and Sorting (分類)**

Classification helps children identify similarities and differences, building logical thinking skills!

1.  **Sorting by One Attribute:**
    *   **Goal:** Children can sort a group of objects based on a single characteristic (e.g., color, size, shape).
    *   **Fun Activity:** "Let's be 'Sorting Superheroes'! We'll sort our toy MTR trains by color (red MTR, green MTR). Or maybe big buttons here, small buttons there! Even our snack time fruit can be sorted: 'Apples here, oranges there!'"
    *   **HK Element:** Toy MTR trains, different colored Lai See (red packets), or sorting local fruits like lychees and longans.

2.  **Matching Identical Objects:**
    *   **Goal:** Children can find and match identical objects or pictures.
    *   **Fun Activity:** "It's a 'Find Your Friend' game! Can you find another 'Char Siu Bao' just like this one? Or match the pairs of HK taxi pictures?" We'll use picture cards or small toy animals.
    *   **HK Element:** Picture cards of common HK items like specific dim sum, local vehicles (taxi, bus), or matching pairs of "pineapple buns" (bo lo bao).

3.  **Identifying "Does Not Belong":**
    *   **Goal:** Children can identify an object that is different or does not belong in a simple group.
    *   **Fun Activity:** "One of these things is not like the others! Look at these three red blocks and one blue block. Which one is different? Or in our basket of toy vegetables (like choi sum and bok choy), if there's a toy car, 'Hmm, does this car belong with the vegetables?'"
    *   **HK Element:** Toy versions of common HK vegetables, or a collection of items from a local market stall (e.g., fruits with one toy).
