**Stage 5: Measurement and Comparison**

**Introduction for Teachers:**
At 3 years old, children are just beginning to understand comparative concepts. Our goal is to introduce "longer/shorter," "taller/shorter," "heavier/lighter," and "bigger/smaller" through direct, hands-on experiences with familiar objects. Formal measurement units are not introduced at this stage; the focus is on developing descriptive vocabulary and observational skills. Encourage children to explore and describe using simple language.

### **Concept 1: Length and Height (Longer/Shorter, Taller/Shorter)**

**Learning Objective:** Children can compare two objects or people and identify which is longer/shorter or taller/shorter.

**Key Vocabulary:**
*   **Longer:** 長啲 (chéung di)
*   **Shorter:** 短啲 (dyún di)
*   **Taller:** 高啲 (gōu di)
*   **Shorter/Lower:** 矮啲 (ái di)

**Activity 1: Ribbon Comparison Fun!**

*   **Materials:** Assorted colorful ribbons or strips of paper of varying lengths (ensure clear differences between two chosen for comparison).
*   **Setup:** Place ribbons in a basket in the center of a table or mat.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Introduction:** "Good morning, little explorers! Today, we're going to compare things! Look at these lovely ribbons!"
    2.  **Teacher Demonstration:** Pick two ribbons (one clearly longer, one clearly shorter). Lay them side-by-side on the table, aligning one end. "Look at my red ribbon and my yellow ribbon. Which one is longer? The red one is *longer*, right? And the yellow one is *shorter*." Point to each as you say the word.
    3.  **Child Exploration:** Invite children to pick two ribbons. "Now it's your turn! Pick any two ribbons you like. Put them next to each other. Can you tell me which one is *longer*? Which one is *shorter*?"
    4.  **Guided Practice:** Circulate and help children align the ribbons. "Wow, Chloe! Your blue ribbon is *longer* than your green ribbon! Very good!" Encourage them to say the comparison words.
*   **Hong Kong Connection:** "Let's compare these toy MTR train carriages! Is this green carriage *longer* or *shorter* than the red one? Maybe we can find the *longest* noodle at lunch today!"

**Activity 2: Tall Towers and Little Houses**

*   **Materials:** Building blocks of various shapes and sizes (e.g., wooden blocks, Duplo).
*   **Setup:** Clear a space for children to build.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Introduction:** "Friends, let's become amazing builders today! We're going to build towers!"
    2.  **Building Challenge:** "Can you build a *tall* tower? And then a *short* house?" Model building a tall tower and a small structure.
    3.  **Comparison:** Once children have built, ask: "Look around! Whose tower is *taller*? Whose house is *shorter*?" Encourage children to stand next to their creations to compare.
    4.  **Group Comparison:** "Let's stand up! Look at Leo and Sarah. Who is *taller*? Who is *shorter*? Can you try to stand *taller*? Can you make yourself *shorter*?" (Encourage physical movement).
*   **Hong Kong Connection:** "Wow! Your tall tower looks like one of the big skyscrapers in Central! And your short house looks like a little village house in the New Territories! Hong Kong has so many *tall* buildings and some *shorter* ones too!"

### **Concept 2: Weight (Heavier/Lighter)**

**Learning Objective:** Children can compare two objects and identify which feels heavier/lighter through direct lifting.

**Key Vocabulary:**
*   **Heavier:** 重啲 (chúng di)
*   **Lighter:** 輕啲 (hīng di)

---

**Activity 1: Mystery Bags Weight Guess!**

*   **Materials:** Several pairs of small, opaque fabric bags (or socks) filled with objects of contrasting weights (e.g., a bag with cotton balls vs. a bag with small stones; a bag with sponges vs. a bag with toy cars; ensure items are safe and sealed).
*   **Setup:** Place pairs of mystery bags on a table.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Introduction:** "We have some mystery bags today! What do you think is inside? Let's use our strong muscles to feel!"
    2.  **Teacher Demonstration:** Pick up two bags, one in each hand. "Hmm, this bag feels so *heavy*! (Struggle slightly). And this bag feels so *light*! (Lift easily). Which one is *heavier*?"
    3.  **Child Exploration:** Invite children to pick two bags. "Can you hold one bag in each hand? Close your eyes and feel! Which one feels *heavy*? Which one feels *light*?"
    4.  **Discussion:** Open the bags to reveal the contents. "Ah-ha! The stones are *heavier* than the cotton balls! That's why this bag felt so *heavy*."
*   **Hong Kong Connection:** "Let's imagine we're at the wet market! Is this big pomelo *heavier* or *lighter* than this small apple? What about a bag of juicy lychees? Is it *heavier* than a single banana?"

**Activity 2: Seesaw Fun (with a simple balance scale)**

*   **Materials:** A simple balance scale (even a hanger with two small bags can work), various everyday objects (e.g., a block, a feather, a small toy, a sponge, a small book).
*   **Setup:** Place the balance scale and objects on a table.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Introduction:** "Look at this special 'seesaw'! When something is *heavier*, it goes down. When something is *lighter*, it goes up!"
    2.  **Teacher Demonstration:** Place a heavy object on one side and a light object on the other. "Look! The block is *heavier*, so it goes down! The feather is *lighter*, so it goes up!"
    3.  **Child Exploration:** "Who wants to try? Pick two things. Put one on each side. What happens?"
    4.  **Guided Inquiry:** "Which side went down? That means it's *heavier*! Which side went up? That's the *lighter* one!"
*   **Hong Kong Connection:** "Let's pretend these are our favourite dim sum items! Is the big 'char siu bao' *heavier* or *lighter* than a tiny 'siu mai'? Let's put them on our seesaw and see!" (Use toy dim sum or pictures).

### **Concept 3: Size and Capacity (Bigger/Smaller, More/Less)**

**Learning Objective:** Children can compare two objects and identify which is bigger/smaller; understand "more" and "less" in the context of quantity or volume.

**Key Vocabulary:**
*   **Bigger:** 大啲 (daai di)
*   **Smaller:** 細啲 (sai di)
*   **More:** 多啲 (dō di)
*   **Less:** 少啲 (síu di)

**Activity 1: Big and Small Sorting Station**

*   **Materials:** A collection of varied objects in clearly different sizes (e.g., big and small balls, big and small toy cars, different sized blocks, big and small plastic fruits/vegetables). Two hula hoops or labeled areas ("Big," "Small").
*   **Setup:** Scatter objects on the floor or a large mat.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Introduction:** "Look at all these interesting things! Some are big, and some are small!"
    2.  **Teacher Demonstration:** Pick up a big ball. "This is a *big* ball! I'll put it in our 'Big' circle." Then pick up a small ball. "This is a *small* ball! It goes in the 'Small' circle."
    3.  **Child Sorting:** "Now, your turn! Can you find something *big* and put it in the 'Big' circle? Can you find something *small* and put it in the 'Small' circle?"
    4.  **Direct Comparison:** Hold up two objects (e.g., a large block and a small block). "Is this block *bigger* or *smaller* than this one? This one is *bigger*! And this one is *smaller*."
*   **Hong Kong Connection:** "Let's look at our Hong Kong coins! Is the five-dollar coin *bigger* or *smaller* than the two-dollar coin? What about a big bus and a small taxi on the street? Which one is *bigger*?"

**Activity 2: Water Play: More or Less?**

*   **Materials:** Various clear plastic containers of different sizes and shapes (e.g., tall cups, wide bowls, small bottles), water, scoops, funnels, sponges.
*   **Setup:** Water play table or basin, ensure children wear aprons.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Introduction:** "Who wants to play with water today? We're going to fill our containers and see which has *more* or *less* water!"
    2.  **Teacher Demonstration:** Take two containers, one larger capacity than the other. Fill the larger one and then pour some into the smaller one. "Look! This big cup has *more* water. This small cup has *less* water." Or, fill two different sized containers. "Which one has *more*? Which one has *less*?"
    3.  **Child Exploration:** Encourage children to fill different containers with water. "Can you make a cup with *more* water? Can you make a bottle with *less* water?"
    4.  **Guided Inquiry:** "Chloe, you have *more* water in your big bowl! Leo, your little cup has *less* water. Can you pour *more* water into your cup?"
*   **Hong Kong Connection:** "Imagine we're having 'yum cha' (dim sum tea)! This big teapot has *more* tea, and your little teacup has *less* tea. Can you pour *more* tea for your teddy bear? Or how about a *big* bowl of wonton noodles versus a *small* bowl of fish balls?"

**General Tips for Teaching Measurement & Comparison:**

*   **Constant Reinforcement:** Use the comparative language ("longer," "shorter," "heavier," "lighter," "bigger," "smaller," "more," "less") throughout the day in various contexts (e.g., lining up, distributing snacks, comparing children's drawings).
*   **Hands-On:** Always prioritize direct manipulation and physical comparison. Let children touch, lift, and arrange objects themselves.
*   **Visual Cues:** Exaggerate your movements and expressions when demonstrating "heavy" or "light," "tall" or "short."
*   **No Formal Units:** Avoid introducing rulers, scales with numbers, or measuring tapes at this stage. The focus is purely on direct comparison.
*   **Encourage Language:** Prompt children with open-ended questions like, "What do you notice about these two?" or "Tell me about them."
*   **Songs and Movement:** Incorporate simple songs or actions that demonstrate big/small, tall/short (e.g., "If You're Happy and You Know It" but with "If you're big and you know it, stretch up tall!").
