### **Progression and Extension to Numbers 4-10:**

*   **Gradual Introduction:** Introduce numbers 4, 5, then 6-10 in subsequent lessons, using the same activity structure. Do not introduce too many new numbers at once.
*   **Varied Manipulatives:**
    *   **Numbers 4-5:** Use Hong Kong-style egg tarts, pineapple buns, or *lai see* (red packets).
    *   **Numbers 6-10:** Use plastic fishballs on skewers (up to 10), small toy MTR trains, building blocks (to create a stack of 10), or counting beads.
*   **"Counting Circle":** Children sit in a circle. One child starts by saying "one," the next says "two," and so on, passing a plush toy (e.g., a panda) around the circle.
*   **"Number Scavenger Hunt":** Hide number cards (1-5, then 1-10) around the classroom. Children find a number card, identify the numeral, and then collect that many of a specific item (e.g., "Find number 4, then bring me 4 blue blocks").
*   **"Number Line Hop":** Create a large number line (1-10) on the floor using masking tape or large number cutouts. Call out a number, and children hop to it.
*   **"Clap, Tap, Stomp":** Call out a number (e.g., "Number 7!"). Children then do 7 claps, 7 taps on their knees, or 7 stomps.
*   **Role-Play:** Set up a pretend market stall (Hong Kong *Dai Pai Dong*). "How many fishballs do you want? Three? Here are ONE, TWO, THREE fishballs!"
*   **Stories & Rhymes:** Continuously use number-themed stories and songs that reinforce counting and number recognition up to 10.

**Educator Notes:**

*   **Repetition is Key:** Young children learn through repeated exposure and practice in various contexts.
*   **Sensory Engagement:** Encourage touching, feeling, and moving with the numbers.
*   **Observation:** Pay attention to children's individual progress. Some may grasp counting quickly, while others need more support with one-to-one correspondence or numeral recognition.
*   **Positive Reinforcement:** Celebrate every effort and correct answers with enthusiasm.
*   **Keep it Fun:** Learning math at this age should be a joyful and playful experience.
