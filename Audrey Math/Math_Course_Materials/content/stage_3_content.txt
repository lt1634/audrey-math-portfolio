## Stage 3: Patterns and Classification for 3-Year-Olds

**Overall Goal:** To introduce the foundational concepts of identifying, continuing, and creating simple patterns, and sorting objects based on a single attribute.

---

### Activity 1: **"Dim Sum Train" - Recognizing and Continuing Simple ABAB Patterns**

**Learning Objective:** Children will be able to recognize and continue a simple two-element (ABAB) pattern.

**Materials:**
*   Laminated pictures or felt cut-outs of two different Hong Kong dim sum items (e.g., *Har Gow* (shrimp dumpling) and *Siu Mai* (pork dumpling)).
*   Large tray or mat.

**Introduction (5 minutes):**
"Good morning, little explorers! Do you love yummy dim sum? Today, we're going to make a special 'Dim Sum Train'! Look, I have *Har Gow* and *Siu Mai*!" (Show pictures, let children name them if they can). "Our train cars follow a pattern – a special order that repeats again and again!"

**Activity (10-15 minutes):**
1.  **Teacher Demonstration:** "Watch me! First, a *Har Gow*, then a *Siu Mai*. Then another *Har Gow*, then another *Siu Mai*. Look at my pattern: Har Gow, Siu Mai, Har Gow, Siu Mai!" (Point to each item as you say its name).
2.  **"What Comes Next?"**: "Now, it's your turn! Har Gow, Siu Mai, Har Gow, Siu Mai... What dim sum comes next to keep our train going?" (Hold up both options, encourage children to choose).
3.  **Group Participation:** Invite children to take turns placing the next dim sum in the sequence. Start with a clear ABAB pattern already laid out.
4.  **Creative Extension (Optional):** "Let's try a different dim sum train! Maybe *Char Siu Bao* (BBQ pork bun) and *Lo Mai Gai* (sticky rice)!" (Switch items to show the concept applies).

**Hong Kong Element:** Uses familiar dim sum items, connecting math to local food culture.
**Engagement:** Hands-on placement, visual repetition, delicious-looking pictures.
**Language:** "Har Gow, Siu Mai," "What comes next?", "Pattern," "Repeat."

### Activity 2: **"Colourful Toy Sort" - Sorting Objects by One Attribute (Colour)**

**Learning Objective:** Children will be able to sort a collection of objects into groups based on their colour.

**Materials:**
*   A mixed collection of small, colourful toys or blocks (e.g., red, blue, yellow, green plastic blocks, small cars, or animal figures).
*   Three or four colourful baskets or mats matching the colours of the toys (e.g., a red basket, a blue basket, a yellow basket).

**Introduction (5 minutes):**
"Oh no! All our toys are mixed up! Our toys need a home. Can you help me put all the toys that are the *same colour* together? This is like cleaning up your toy box at home!" (Show a basket and a matching toy). "Look, this is a red basket. Where should the red block go?"

**Activity (10-15 minutes):**
1.  **Teacher Demonstration:** "First, let's find all the **red** toys. I see a red block! Into the red basket it goes! Look, a red car! Into the red basket!" (Demonstrate sorting a few red items).
2.  **Guided Sorting:** "Now, who can help me find a **blue** toy? Where should it go?" (Guide children to the blue basket). "Excellent! All the blue toys will go here."
3.  **Independent Sorting:** Spread the mixed toys on a mat. Encourage children to pick up a toy, identify its colour, and place it into the corresponding coloured basket.
4.  **Verbal Reinforcement:** As children sort, use descriptive language: "You found a yellow block for the yellow basket! Wonderful! All the yellow items are together now."

**Hong Kong Element:** Relates to common toys found in Hong Kong homes and the idea of tidying up.
**Engagement:** Hands-on manipulation of toys, clear visual feedback (baskets filling up).
**Language:** "Same colour," "Different colour," "Sort," "Group," naming colours (red, blue, yellow, green).

### Activity 3: **"MTR Pair Match-Up" - Matching Identical Objects**

**Learning Objective:** Children will be able to find and match two identical objects.

**Materials:**
*   Laminated picture cards, with two identical copies of each. Use pictures of common Hong Kong objects (e.g., MTR train, Star Ferry, a specific Hong Kong snack like an egg tart, a bowl of wonton noodles).
*   A large flat surface (table or floor).

**Introduction (5 minutes):**
"Choo choo! Today we're going on a matching adventure, just like finding two of the same MTR train! Look at these fun pictures! Each one has a twin, exactly the same!" (Show an example of a pair).

**Activity (10-15 minutes):**
1.  **Teacher Demonstration:** "I have two pictures of the MTR train. Are they the same? Yes! They are twins! I'm going to put them together." (Place one card down, then find its identical match and place it next to it).
2.  **"Find My Twin!":** Lay out several single picture cards (e.g., MTR train, Star Ferry, egg tart, wonton noodles) spread out on the table.
3.  **Child Participation:** "Now, it's your turn! Can you help me find the twin for this MTR train?" (Hold up an identical MTR train card).
4.  **Guided Matching:** Once a child finds a match, encourage them to say, "Same!" or "Twins!" Place the matched pairs together. Continue until all pairs are matched.
5.  **Increase Complexity (Optional):** Once proficient, turn some cards face down for a simple memory matching game.

**Hong Kong Element:** Uses iconic Hong Kong imagery (MTR, Star Ferry, local food) to make the activity culturally relevant and engaging.
**Engagement:** Visual recognition, active searching, satisfying "click" when a pair is found.
**Language:** "Same," "Twins," "Match," "Find."

**General Educator Tips for 3-Year-Olds:**
*   **Keep it short:** Max 15-20 minutes per focused activity.
*   **Repeat often:** Young children learn through repetition. Revisit these activities regularly with different materials.
*   **Positive reinforcement:** "Wow, you found the matching *Har Gow*!" "You put all the red blocks in the red basket, super job!"
*   **Flexibility:** If children lose interest, switch activities or take a break.
*   **Connect to play:** Encourage children to use these skills during free play (e.g., sorting toys in the dramatic play area).
