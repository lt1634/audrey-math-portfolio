*   **(Song - to a simple tune like 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' or a familiar HK children's song tune):**
    *   "Dim sum, dim sum, yummy food,
    *   Learning math, feels so good!
    *   Counting things, one by one,
    *   Math adventures, lots of fun!"
*   **(Teacher):** "Fantastic! Today, we're going to play with our yummy dim sum and fishballs! We'll learn about putting them together to get MORE, and taking them away to have LESS. Are you excited?" (Encourage 'Yes!' and enthusiastic responses).

**2. Activity 1: Adding More Dim Sum!** (Basic Addition up to 5) (10-12 minutes)

*   **Concept:** "Put together," "altogether," "how many now?"
*   **Materials:** Toy 'siu mai', toy 'har gow', small plates.
*   **(Teacher introduces 'Chef Chan' puppet/character):** "Look! This is Chef Chan! He loves making delicious dim sum for everyone in Hong Kong."
*   **(Teacher - demonstrating clearly on a central mat):** "Chef Chan made **two** yummy siu mai for me. Let's count them: One, two. (Place 2 siu mai on a plate). Yum yum!"
*   **(Teacher):** "But oh! My friend is coming! I need more siu mai! Chef Chan is adding **one more** siu mai! (Place 1 more siu mai next to the others). Now, how many siu mai do I have **altogether**? Let's count them all: One, two, three! Wow! Two siu mai plus one more makes three siu mai!"
*   **(Teacher - involving children):** "Now it's your turn, little chefs! Everyone take **three** yummy har gow for your plate. Count them! One, two, three!" (Wait for children to do so, assist if needed).
*   **(Teacher):** "Good! Now, a customer wants **two more** har gow! Please add **two more** har gow to your plate. (Allow time). Now, how many har gow do you have **altogether**? Let's count them all together!" (Guide counting: "One, two, three, four, five! Excellent! Three har gow plus two more makes five har gow!")
*   **(Repeat with another combination, e.g., 2 char siu bao + 2 char siu bao = 4).**
*   **(Teacher):** "Good job, little chefs! When we put things together, we get **more**! We count them all to see how many **altogether**!"

**3. Activity 2: Taking Away Fishballs!** (Basic Subtraction up to 5) (10-12 minutes)

*   **Concept:** "Take away," "gone," "how many left?"
*   **Materials:** Toy 'fishballs', small bowls or cups for each child.
*   **(Teacher):** "Who likes yummy fishballs? (Encourage 'Me!' responses, connecting to HK street food). Chef Chan also makes super delicious fishballs!"
*   **(Teacher - demonstrating):** "I have **four** yummy fishballs in my bowl. Let's count: One, two, three, four. (Place 4 fishballs in a bowl)."
*   **(Teacher):** "Oh! I'm so hungry! I'm going to eat **one** fishball! (Pretend to eat, remove 1 fishball from the bowl). Mmm, yummy! How many fishballs are **left** in my bowl now? Let's count: One, two, three! Look! Four fishballs, then I ate one, and now there are three left!"
*   **(Teacher - involving children):** "Now everyone put **five** fishballs into your bowl. Count them carefully: One, two, three, four, five!" (Assist as needed).
*   **(Teacher):** "You are so hungry too! Let's eat **two** fishballs! (Children remove 2 fishballs from their bowl). Mmm! How many fishballs are **left** now? Count them!" (Guide counting: "One, two, three! Great! Five fishballs, take away two, leaves three fishballs!")
*   **(Repeat with another combination, e.g., 3 fishballs - 1 fishball = 2).**
*   **(Teacher):** "You are super at taking away! When we take things away, we have **less**! We count to see how many are **left**!"
