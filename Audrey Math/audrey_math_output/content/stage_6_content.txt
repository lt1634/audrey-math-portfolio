**Stage 6: Space and Problem Solving**

**Theme:** "Our Hong Kong Adventure: Where is Everything?"

**Learning Objectives:**
By the end of this stage, children will be able to:
*   Identify and use common positional words: "in," "on," "under," "next to," "front," "back," "through."
*   Follow simple two-step directions involving spatial concepts.
*   Solve basic spatial problems, such as navigating a small obstacle course or fitting objects into designated spaces.
*   Develop an understanding of relative positions in their environment.

**Key Vocabulary:**
*   **Spatial:** In, On, Under, Next to, Front, Back, Through, Up, Down, Here, There.
*   **Action:** Put, Find, Go, Come.

**Activity 1: Dim Sum Hide-and-Seek! (Positional Words)**

**Materials:**
*   Large picture or toy replica of a Hong Kong dim sum trolley (or simply use a table).
*   Assortment of soft toy or laminated picture dim sum items (e.g., *siew mai* - 燒賣, *har gow* - 蝦餃, *char siu bao* - 叉燒包, *gai daan jai* - 雞蛋仔 / egg waffle).
*   Small containers, cups, napkins, or small plates.
*   A 'Chef Panda' puppet or soft toy.

**Introduction (5 minutes):**
"Good morning, little chefs! Today we're going to a pretend dim sum restaurant! Do you like *siew mai*? (Show picture/toy) Yummy! But oh no, our Chef Panda needs help! All the dim sum is everywhere!"

**Activity (15-20 minutes):**
1.  **Teacher introduces Chef Panda:** "Chef Panda needs our help to put the dim sum in the right places for the customers!"
2.  **Guided Placement:**
    *   "Can you help Chef Panda put the *har gow* **in** the steamer basket?" (Encourage children to pick up the *har gow* and place it correctly.)
    *   "Now, let's put the *siew mai* **on** the big plate."
    *   "Oh, a naughty little *char siu bao* is hiding! Can you find it **under** the napkin?" (Encourage children to lift the napkin.)
    *   "Let's put the yummy *gai daan jai* **next to** the teapot."
    *   "Where is Chef Panda? Is he standing **in front** of the trolley, or **behind** it?" (Move the Chef Panda and ask children to identify its position.)
3.  **Child-led Placement:** "Now it's your turn! Where would you like to put the steamed buns? Can you put them **on** the table? How about the egg tarts? Can you put them **in** the small box?"
4.  **Reinforcement:** As children place items, repeat the positional words. "Yes! The *siew mai* is **on** the plate!"

**Extension:**
*   Play "I Spy" with the dim sum: "I spy something yummy **in** the basket!"
*   Have children give instructions to each other: "Put the *har gow* **next to** the *siew mai*!"

**Activity 2: "MTR Journey: Through the Tunnel!" (Spatial Problem Solving & Navigation)**

**Materials:**
*   Large cardboard boxes (taped together to form a tunnel).
*   Soft cushions or small mats.
*   "Stepping stone" mats or large paper circles.
*   Pictures of Hong Kong landmarks (e.g., Tsing Ma Bridge, ferry, Lion Rock) placed along the 'journey'.
*   Small 'MTR train' cut-outs or toys.

**Introduction (5 minutes):**
"Choo choo! All aboard the MTR train! We're going on an exciting journey all around Hong Kong! But we need to be clever to get to all the places!" (Show MTR picture or train toy).

**Activity (20-25 minutes):**
1.  **Setting up the 'Track':** Arrange the tunnel, cushions, and stepping stones to create a simple, safe obstacle course in the classroom. This represents an MTR journey.
2.  **Guided Journey:**
    *   "First stop: Let's go **through** the MTR tunnel! Crawl like a little caterpillar!" (Guide children to crawl through the tunnel.)
    *   "Wow, we're out! Look, we're **in front** of the big Tsing Ma Bridge! (Point to picture). Now, step **over** the bumpy 'hills' (cushions). Be careful!"
    *   "Next, we need to go to the ferry terminal! Walk slowly **on** the stepping stones! One foot, then the other!"
    *   "Almost there! We need to go **under** the big 'rainbow' (teacher holds a large scarf or hoop) to get to the harbour!"
    *   "Hooray! We made it! We're **next to** the Star Ferry! (Point to picture). Give yourselves a big cheer!"
3.  **Problem Solving:** Encourage children to figure out *how* to go through the tunnel, *how* to step over the cushions, etc. Provide simple verbal prompts rather than doing it for them.
    *   "How can we get to the other side of this tunnel?"
    *   "Can you find a way to get *over* this big cushion?"
4.  **Repeat Journey:** Let children take turns leading or navigating specific parts of the 'track.'

**Extension:**
*   Add sound effects: "Ding dong!" for train doors, "Choo choo!" for movement.
*   Ask children to describe where they are in relation to the landmarks: "The Lion Rock is **behind** us now!"
*   Let children help build parts of the 'track' using available blocks or cushions.

**Cool-down & Wrap-up (5 minutes):**

**Activity: "Hong Kong Home Story Time"**
*   **Materials:** A simple picture book about a child's day in Hong Kong, or photos of common HK scenes (e.g., apartment, park, market).
*   **Activity:** Gather children for story time. As you read or show pictures, ask questions incorporating the learned spatial words.
    *   "Look, the little boy is playing **in** the park. Where is his ball? Is it **under** the slide?"
    *   "The lady is shopping **in** the market. Where is the big red apple? It's **on** the table!"
    *   "Now we are all **in** our classroom, **next to** our friends. Give your friend a wave!"
