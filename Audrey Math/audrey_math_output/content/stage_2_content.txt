#### **Activity 1: Welcome & Warm-up – "Shape & Color Hunt Song!"**

**(5-7 minutes)**

**Teacher:** "Hello, my little friends! (你好, nei ho!) Are you ready to sing and play today? Let's look around our classroom, what can we see?"

*(Sing a simple song, e.g., to the tune of "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star")*
"Shapes and colors, everywhere!
Shapes and colors, in the air!
Look for round things, (Yuen Ying!)
Look for square things, (Jeng Fong Ying!)
Shapes and colors, everywhere!
Let's find colors, if we dare!
Red (紅色!), Yellow (黃色!), let's explore!
Shapes and colors, we want more!"

**Activity:** As you sing, point to a circle (like a clock) and a square (like a window pane), and then to something red and something yellow in the classroom. Encourage children to point with you.

#### **Activity 2: Discovering Shapes! (圓形 - Circle, 正方形 - Square)**

**(10-12 minutes)**

**Part A: Shape Introduction with Real Objects**

**Teacher:** "Wow, we found so many things! Today, we're going to learn about two special shapes. Look at this! (Hold up a **circle** cut-out). This is a **Circle**! (圓形, Yuen Ying!) Can you say 'Circle'? It's round and round, like a ball! Let's make a big circle with our arms!" (Encourage arm movements).

"Now, look at this! (Hold up a **square** cut-out). This is a **Square**! (正方形, Jeng Fong Ying!) Can you say 'Square'? It has four straight sides, all the same! Like a window!"

**Activity: "Shape Detective!"**
**Teacher:** "Let's be Shape Detectives! I have a basket of special Hong Kong treats. What shape is this yummy round cookie? (Show a round cookie). Yes, it's a **Circle**! (圓形!) What about this crunchy cracker? (Show a square cracker). That's right, it's a **Square**! (正方形!) What shape is a yummy pineapple bun (波蘿包, bo lo bao) sometimes? A bit like a circle! Look at this little toy taxi sign – a square!"

*(Go around the room, pointing to familiar objects: a round clock, a square tissue box, a circular toy wheel, a square building block.)*
**Teacher:** "Look, look! A round clock! A square window! (睇, tai!)"

**Part B: Hands-on Playdough Shapes**

**Teacher:** "Now, let's make our own shapes! I have some soft playdough. Can you roll your playdough into a long snake? Good! Now, can you connect the ends to make a **Circle**? (圓形!) Wow, good job! Now, can you press it flat and cut it into a **Square**? (正方形!) Use your hands to make the straight sides."

#### **Activity 3: Exploring Colors! (紅色 - Red, 黃色 - Yellow)**

**(10-12 minutes)**

**Part A: Color Introduction with Real Objects**

**Teacher:** "Our shapes are so pretty! (好靚呀, ho leng ah!) Now let's find some bright colors! Look at this! (Hold up a **red** flashcard). This is **Red**! (紅色, Hung Sik!) Can you say 'Red'?"

"And look at this! (Hold up a **yellow** flashcard). This is **Yellow**! (黃色, Wong Sik!) Can you say 'Yellow'?"

**Activity: "Colorful Hong Kong Basket!"**
**Teacher:** "I have a special basket full of things we might see in Hong Kong. Who can find something **Red**? (Show a red apple, a small red lantern, a toy red HK taxi). Wow, a red apple! A red lantern for celebrations! And a red taxi! (紅色, Hung Sik!)"

"Now, who can find something **Yellow**? (Show a yellow banana, a yellow MTR train toy, a yellow rubber duck). Yes, a yellow banana! A yellow MTR train! (黃色, Wong Sik!)"

**Part B: Finger Painting Fun!**

**Teacher:** "Now, let's get our hands colorful! We have red paint and yellow paint. Take a little red paint, dab, dab, dab! Make a red circle! (紅色圓形!) Now, take some yellow paint, dab, dab, dab! Make a yellow square! (黃色正方形!) What happens if we mix them a little? Ooh, it changes!" (Keep focus on the primary colors for 3-year-olds, but acknowledge incidental mixing).

#### **Activity 4: Combining Shapes & Colors! – "My Hong Kong Bus!" Craft**

**(10-15 minutes)**

**Teacher:** "We know shapes and we know colors! Let's put them together! We're going to make our own Hong Kong bus or MTR train! What shape is a bus? It's like a big **Square** (正方形!) but longer (a rectangle!). And what color are some buses? Red! (紅色!)"

**Activity:** Provide each child with a large, pre-cut rectangular "bus body" (or let them try to cut it from paper with safety scissors if appropriate). Have a tray of pre-cut **red circles** (for bus lights/wheels) and **yellow squares** (for windows).
**Teacher:** "Let's stick a **red circle** for the bus light! (紅色圓形!) And now, let's put some **yellow squares** for the bus windows! (黃色正方形!) What a beautiful bus! (好靚呀!)"

*(Assist children in gluing the shapes onto their "bus." Encourage them to name the shape and color as they place each piece.)*

#### **Activity 5: Movement & Gross Motor – "Shape Hopscotch!"**

**(7-10 minutes)**

**Teacher:** "Time to move our bodies! Let's go outside or to a clear area. I've drawn some big **circles** (圓形!) and **squares** (正方形!) on the ground (using chalk or masking tape). When I say 'Jump to the RED Circle!' you hop to the red circle! When I say 'Jump to the YELLOW Square!' you hop to the yellow square!"

**Activity:** Call out combinations of shapes and colors. Start simple (e.g., "Red Circle!") and progress to slightly more complex (e.g., "Hop from the Red Circle to the Yellow Square!"). Ensure safety and provide plenty of space.

#### **Activity 6: Story Time & Cool Down – "The Little Red Taxi's Big Adventure"**

**(8-10 minutes)**

**Teacher:** "Let's sit down quietly now. I have a special story about a little taxi, just like the ones we see in Hong Kong! (Show a simple picture book or use a puppet of a red taxi)."

**Story Idea:** "Once upon a time, in a busy city called Hong Kong, there lived a friendly little **Red Taxi** (紅色士的). Its body was shaped like a big **Square** (正方形!) with round, **black circles** (圓形!) for wheels. One sunny morning, the Red Taxi saw a big, **yellow** (黃色!) MTR train zoom past. 'Wow!' thought the Red Taxi, 'I want to see the whole city!' So, the Red Taxi drove past round dim sum shops (圓形!), stopped at a square bus stop (正方形!), and even saw a beautiful red flower (紅色花!) growing by the road. What an amazing day for the Red Taxi!"

**Discussion:** "What color was the taxi? (Red!) What shape were its wheels? (Circles!) What color was the MTR train? (Yellow!) Did you see anything round today? Anything square? Any red things? Any yellow things?"

#### **Activity 7: Wrap-up & Goodbye!**

**(3-5 minutes)**

**Teacher:** "What an amazing day of discovering shapes and colors! We found **Circles** (圓形!), **Squares** (正方形!), **Red** (紅色!), and **Yellow** (黃色!) everywhere! You all did a fantastic job! Let's wave goodbye! (Goodbye, 再見, joi gin!) See you next time for more fun!"

*(Encourage children to help tidy up, reinforcing sorting by color or shape if possible.)*

**Early Childhood Educator Tips for Stage 2:**

*   **Repetition is Key:** Young children learn through repeated exposure. Use the shape and color names frequently and consistently.
*   **Encourage Language:** Prompt children with questions like "What color is this?" or "What shape is that?" Encourage them to use the new vocabulary in their responses.
*   **Positive Reinforcement:** Praise effort and participation ("You tried so hard to make a square!").
*   **Connect to Home:** Encourage parents to continue the learning at home by pointing out shapes and colors in their environment (e.g., "What color is your bowl?").
*   **Flexibility:** Be prepared to adapt activities based on the children's engagement and interest levels. If they are highly focused on one activity, let it continue a little longer. If they lose interest, transition smoothly.
*   **Sensory Exploration:** Allow children to touch, feel, and manipulate materials. The more senses involved, the deeper the learning.
*   **Differentiation:** For children who grasp concepts quickly, challenge them to find more complex shapes or a wider range of colors. For those needing more support, provide more one-on-one guidance and simpler prompts.
