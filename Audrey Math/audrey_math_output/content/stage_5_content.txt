### **Activity 1: How Long is Our Noodle? (Length Comparison)**

**Concept:** Longer vs. Shorter

**Materials:**
*   Two strips of paper/ribbon of clearly different lengths (e.g., one long like a noodle, one short)
*   Various pairs of objects: Two toy cars, two pencils, two plastic *char siu* (BBQ pork) strips (prop), two small scarves.
*   Picture cards of *cheung fun* (rice noodle rolls) – one very long, one shorter.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Warm-up & Introduction:**
    *   "Good morning, little friends! Let's sing our 'Hello' song!"
    *   "Today, we are going to be 'Measurement Detectives'! We will look closely at things and see how long, how tall, how heavy they are!"
    *   "Look what I have here! (Show the two paper strips). Hmm, this one is **長 (cheung)** – long, like a super long MTR train! And this one is **短 (duen)** – short, like a little toy car. Can you say **長 (cheung)**? Can you say **短 (duen)**?"

2.  **Hands-on Exploration (Teacher-led):**
    *   "Let's make some yummy *cheung fun* today! Look at these pictures." (Show the *cheung fun* pictures). "Which *cheung fun* is **長 (cheung)** – long? And which one is **短 (duen)** – short? Yes, very good!"
    *   Place two real ribbons on the table. "Look at these ribbons! Which one do you think is **longer**? And which one is **shorter**?"
    *   Encourage children to hold them side-by-side to compare. "Yes! This one is **longer** (drag finger along it), and this one is **shorter** (drag finger along it)."
    *   "Now, let's look at our toy cars! One red car, one blue car. Which car is **longer**? Which car is **shorter**? Put them next to each other to see!"

3.  **Creative Activity: Noodle Play!**
    *   Give each child two pieces of playdough or clay.
    *   "Let's make some noodles! Roll, roll, roll! Make one noodle very **長 (cheung)** – long! And one noodle **短 (duen)** – short! Wow, look at your long noodles and short noodles!"
    *   Walk around, praising children and reinforcing vocabulary. "Wow, Leo, your long noodle is so **長 (cheung)**! Emily, your short noodle is so **短 (duen)**!"

**Extension:**
*   Compare the lengths of children's pencils or their own arms (using a non-standard unit like a block).
*   Go on a "long/short hunt" around the classroom.

### **Activity 2: Tall Buildings & Short Friends (Height Comparison)**

**Concept:** Taller vs. Shorter

**Materials:**
*   Two blocks towers of clearly different heights (e.g., one tall like IFC, one short like a small house).
*   Pictures of a tall person and a short person, or a tall tree and a short bush.
*   Puppets or stuffed animals of different heights.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Story & Introduction:**
    *   "Hello, building explorers! In Hong Kong, we see so many buildings, some are super **高 (go)** – tall! Like the IFC building! And some are **矮 (nai)** – short, like our school! Can you say **高 (go)**? Can you say **矮 (nai)**?"
    *   "Once upon a time, there were two friends, Tall Giraffe and Short Bunny. Tall Giraffe was so **高 (go)**, he could touch the clouds! Short Bunny was so **矮 (nai)**, he only reached Giraffe's knees!" (Use puppets/pictures to illustrate).

2.  **Hands-on Exploration (Teacher-led):**
    *   Show the two block towers. "Look at these block towers! Which one is **高 (go)** – tall? And which one is **矮 (nai)** – short? Yes! The yellow one is **taller** than the red one."
    *   "Let's see who is **taller** or **shorter**! Can two friends stand back-to-back? Let's see! Hmm, Leo is **taller** than Emily today! And Emily is **shorter** than Leo. It's okay, everyone grows!" (Model respectful comparison).

3.  **Game: Build-a-City!**
    *   Provide various sized building blocks.
    *   "Let's build our own Hong Kong city! Can you build a **高 (go)** – tall building? And can you build an **矮 (nai)** – short building?"
    *   Encourage children to compare their buildings. "Wow, Chloe, your blue building is **taller** than your green building! Gwo Ho Ho! (Very good!)"

**Extension:**
*   Compare the heights of different classroom furniture (e.g., table vs. chair).
*   Arrange three objects from shortest to tallest (initially teacher-assisted).

### **Activity 3: Heavy Dim Sum, Light Dim Sum (Weight Comparison)**

**Concept:** Heavier vs. Lighter

**Materials:**
*   A simple balance scale or a coat hanger with two baskets/bags.
*   Pairs of objects with noticeable weight differences:
    *   A real orange vs. a small sponge.
    *   A small rock vs. a feather.
    *   A full pencil case vs. an empty one.
    *   Toy *siew mai* (pork dumpling, could be heavier) vs. toy *har gow* (shrimp dumpling, could be lighter, or just different sized toy food).
    *   A full bottle of water vs. an empty one.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Introduction & Demonstration:**
    *   "Hello, chef helpers! When we go to *yum cha* (dim sum lunch) in Hong Kong, some dim sum baskets feel **重 (chung)** – heavy, and some feel **輕 (hing)** – light! Can you say **重 (chung)**? Can you say **輕 (hing)**?"
    *   Show the balance scale. "This is our 'magic scale'! It helps us see which one is **heavier** and which one is **lighter**."
    *   Place an orange in one basket and a sponge in the other. "Look! The orange goes down, down, down! It's **重 (chung)** – heavy! The sponge goes up, up, up! It's **輕 (hing)** – light!"

2.  **Hands-on Exploration (Teacher-led with small groups):**
    *   Provide children with various pairs of objects.
    *   "Let's be weight detectives! Hold one object in one hand, and the other object in your other hand. Which one feels **heavier**? Which one feels **lighter**?"
    *   "Now, let's use our magic scale! Put the red toy in one basket, and the blue toy in the other. Which one is **heavier**? The **heavier** one goes down! Which one is **lighter**? The **lighter** one goes up!"
    *   "Let's compare our yummy dim sum! Here's a toy *siew mai* (dim sum) and a toy *dan tat* (egg tart). Which one do you think is **重 (chung)** – heavier? Which one is **輕 (hing)** – lighter? Let's check with the scale!"

3.  **Game: Heavy or Light Basket!**
    *   Prepare two opaque bags. Place a noticeably heavy object in one (e.g., a few blocks) and a noticeably light object in the other (e.g., cotton balls).
    *   "Close your eyes! Feel this bag. Is it **重 (chung)** – heavy, or **輕 (hing)** – light?" Let children feel the bags.
    *   "Let's check! Open your eyes! Which one was **heavier**? Which one was **lighter**?"

**Extension:**
*   Compare the weight of their own school bags when empty vs. full.
*   Use body movements: "Show me heavy!" (Squat down) "Show me light!" (Jump up lightly).

### **Activity 4: More Rice, Less Rice (Capacity Comparison)**

**Concept:** More vs. Less

**Materials:**
*   Two clear plastic cups or bowls of the same size, but filled with clearly different amounts of water, rice, or sand.
*   Scoops, funnels, small jugs.
*   Various sized containers (bowls, cups, bottles).
*   A small bowl (like for *tau fu fa* – tofu pudding) and a larger bowl.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Introduction & Demonstration:**
    *   "Hello, little chefs! Today, we're talking about **多 (dor)** – more, and **少 (siu)** – less! When we eat yummy rice, sometimes we want **多 (dor)** – more rice, and sometimes we have **少 (siu)** – less rice. Can you say **多 (dor)**? Can you say **少 (siu)**?"
    *   Show two identical clear cups, one almost full of water, one with only a little water.
    *   "Look at these cups! Which cup has **多 (dor)** – more water? Which cup has **少 (siu)** – less water? The blue cup has **more** water, and the red cup has **less** water."

2.  **Hands-on Exploration (Water/Sand Play):**
    *   Set up a water table or sand pit with various containers (different sizes, shapes), scoops, and funnels.
    *   "Let's play with water/sand! Fill your cup. Can you make one cup have **多 (dor)** – more water, and another cup have **少 (siu)** – less water?"
    *   Encourage children to pour and compare. "Look! That big bowl has **多 (dor)** – more sand, and that tiny cup has **少 (siu)** – less sand."
    *   "Here are two bowls for *tau fu fa* (tofu pudding). Which one do you want for **多 (dor)** – more *tau fu fa*? Which one would have **少 (siu)** – less *tau fu fa*?" (Point to the larger and smaller bowl).

3.  **Sorting Game: Full or Empty?**
    *   Provide various small containers (e.g., toy *siu mai* containers, small cups). Some are full of beads/buttons (toy food), some are empty.
    *   "Let's sort! Put all the containers with **多 (dor)** – more beads here (point to one area), and all the containers with **少 (siu)** – less beads or empty here (point to another area)."

**Extension:**
*   Compare the amount of blocks in two different sized buckets.
*   During snack time, compare who has "more biscuits" or "less fruit" (in a positive, sharing context).

**Concluding Song/Rhyme (to the tune of "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"):**

Long and short, high and low,
Heavy, light, watch them go!
More or less, we can see,
Measurement fun for you and me!
Gwo Ho Ho! (Very good!) Measurement fun!
