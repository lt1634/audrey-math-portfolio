## Stage 3: Patterns and Classification – Let's Explore and Discover!

**Learning Objectives (for the children):**
*   I can sort objects by colour, size, or type.
*   I can find what comes next in a simple pattern.
*   I can make my own simple patterns!

---

### Part 1: Sorting and Classification (By Colour, Size, and Type)

**Big Idea:** We can put things into groups that are the same. This helps us understand the world around us!

---

#### **Activity 1: Colourful Dim Sum Sorting!**

*   **Learning Focus:** Sorting by colour.
*   **Materials:**
    *   Toy dim sum of different colours (e.g., red char siu bao, white har gao, green vegetable dumplings, yellow siew mai).
    *   Three baskets or plates, each with a different coloured circle sticker (e.g., red, white, green).
*   **How to Play:**
    1.  **Introduction (Teacher):** "Good morning, little chefs! Look what I brought today! Yummy dim sum! Do you like char siu bao? Mmm! But oh no, all my dim sum are mixed up! Can you help me put them in the right baskets?"
    2.  **Demonstration (Teacher):** Hold up a red char siu bao. "Look, this is red! Where should it go? Ah, in the red basket! *Place it in.* Now, this one is white! Let's find the white basket. *Place it in.*"
    3.  **Guided Practice (Children):** "Your turn! Pick a dim sum. What colour is it? Which basket should it go into? Show me!" Encourage children to name the colour as they sort.
    4.  **Independent Exploration:** Let children sort all the dim sum. You can add more colours or change the dim sum types next time.
*   **Key Language:** "What colour is this?" "Red goes with red!" "Where does this one belong?" "Same colour!"
*   **Tips for Success:** Start with just two colours, then add more as children get better. Praise effort and correct sorting gently.

#### **Activity 2: Big and Small Market Baskets!**

*   **Learning Focus:** Sorting by size (big/small).
*   **Materials:**
    *   Toy fruits/vegetables in two distinct sizes (e.g., big apples and small apples, big oranges and small oranges, big bok choy and small bok choy).
    *   Two shopping baskets or boxes, one labeled "BIG" and one labeled "SMALL" (with pictures).
*   **How to Play:**
    1.  **Introduction (Teacher):** "Today we are going to the fresh market in Hong Kong! We need to buy fruits and vegetables. But we have two special baskets – one for BIG things and one for SMALL things. Can you help me sort them?"
    2.  **Demonstration (Teacher):** Hold up a big apple and a small apple. "Wow, look! This apple is BIG! This apple is SMALL! Big goes here! *Put big apple in 'BIG' basket.* Small goes here! *Put small apple in 'SMALL' basket.*"
    3.  **Guided Practice (Children):** "Now you try! Pick up a fruit or vegetable. Is it BIG or SMALL? Which basket will it go into?"
    4.  **Independent Exploration:** Allow children to sort all the items. You can ask them to compare items: "Is this banana bigger than that banana?"
*   **Key Language:** "Big!" "Small!" "Is this big or small?" "Put the big ones here, and the small ones there."
*   **Tips for Success:** Ensure a clear size difference between the objects. Use real objects if possible for a more tactile experience.

#### **Activity 3: Animal Families and MTR Rides!**

*   **Learning Focus:** Sorting by type/category.
*   **Materials:**
    *   A mixed group of toy animals (e.g., farm animals like a cow, pig; sea animals like a fish, crab) and toy vehicles (e.g., MTR train, bus, car).
    *   Two designated areas or mats: one labeled "Animals' Home" and another labeled "Vehicles' Garage" (with pictures).
*   **How to Play:**
    1.  **Introduction (Teacher):** "Look at all these friends! We have fluffy animals and fast vehicles, like our MTR train! They all got mixed up. Can you help send the animals to their home and the vehicles to their garage?"
    2.  **Demonstration (Teacher):** Pick up a toy cow. "Moo, moo! Is this an animal or a vehicle? It's an animal! So, off to Animals' Home! *Place it.* Now, a little MTR train! Choo-choo! Is this an animal? No! It's a vehicle! So, to Vehicles' Garage! *Place it.*"
    3.  **Guided Practice (Children):** "Your turn! Pick one. Is it an animal or a vehicle? Where does it belong?"
    4.  **Independent Exploration:** Children continue sorting. You can extend this by asking, "Which animal makes this sound?" or "Where does this vehicle usually go in Hong Kong?"
*   **Key Language:** "Is this an animal or a vehicle?" "This belongs with the animals." "This belongs with the vehicles." "Same kind!"
*   **Tips for Success:** Use clear and distinct categories. Keep the number of items manageable for 3-year-olds.

### Part 2: Simple Patterns (AB, AAB)

**Big Idea:** Patterns are things that repeat over and over again. We can find patterns everywhere!

---

#### **Activity 1: MTR Train Colour Pattern!**

*   **Learning Focus:** Recognizing and extending an ABAB colour pattern.
*   **Materials:**
    *   Large coloured blocks or construction paper strips in two colours (e.g., Red, Yellow).
    *   A long strip of paper or a line on the floor to build the "train."
*   **How to Play:**
    1.  **Introduction (Teacher):** "Let's build a long MTR train, just like the ones we see in Hong Kong! But this train will have a special colour pattern!"
    2.  **Demonstration (Teacher):** Start building a simple ABAB pattern. "Look, a **Red** block. Then a **Yellow** block. What comes next? Yes, **Red** again! And then... **Yellow**! We have a Red-Yellow-Red-Yellow train!"
    3.  **Guided Practice (Children):** "My turn to build, your turn to tell me! After Yellow, what colour block should I put? (Wait for children to say 'Red'). Yes! Red! Now, after Red, what colour?"
    4.  **Independent Exploration:** Give children a tray of Red and Yellow blocks. Start a pattern (e.g., Red-Yellow-Red-Yellow...). "Can you make our MTR train longer following the pattern? What comes next?"
*   **Key Language:** "What colour is next?" "Red, yellow, red, yellow..." "It's a pattern!"
*   **Tips for Success:** Use clear, vibrant colours. Start with just two repetitions of the pattern (Red-Yellow-Red-Yellow) and gradually extend.

#### **Activity 2: Happy Fruit Skewers Pattern!**

*   **Learning Focus:** Recognizing and extending an AAB AAB pattern using different objects.
*   **Materials:**
    *   Toy fruits in two different types (e.g., two toy apples, one toy orange).
    *   Craft sticks or pipe cleaners to represent skewers.
*   **How to Play:**
    1.  **Introduction (Teacher):** "Who wants to make a yummy fruit skewer, just like the ones you find at the night markets in Hong Kong? We'll make a special pattern!"
    2.  **Demonstration (Teacher):** Make an AAB pattern on a skewer. "Look! Apple, Apple, Orange! That's my pattern. Apple, Apple, Orange! What did I put first?"
    3.  **Guided Practice (Children):** "Let's make another one! Apple, Apple... what comes next? (Wait for 'Orange'). Yes! Orange! Good job! Apple, Apple, Orange!"
    4.  **Independent Exploration:** Give each child some toy fruits and a skewer. "Can you make an Apple-Apple-Orange pattern? What comes after the second apple? What comes after the orange?"
*   **Key Language:** "What comes next in our pattern?" "Apple, apple, orange, apple, apple, orange!" "Can you make your own?"
*   **Tips for Success:** Use distinct objects. Start with the teacher making the first full pattern for children to copy. Encourage them to "say" the pattern as they build it.

#### **Activity 3: Clap-Stomp Fun Pattern!**

*   **Learning Focus:** Creating and recognizing patterns using body movements.
*   **Materials:** None! Just our bodies!
*   **How to Play:**
    1.  **Introduction (Teacher):** "Let's make some fun patterns with our bodies! Are you ready to move?"
    2.  **Demonstration (Teacher):** "Watch me! Clap, Stomp, Clap, Stomp! My turn again: Clap, Stomp, Clap, Stomp!"
    3.  **Guided Practice (Children):** "Now everyone with me! Clap, Stomp, Clap, Stomp! Great job! Can we do it again?"
    4.  **Independent Exploration:**
        *   "My turn to start, your turn to finish the pattern! I'll do 'Clap, Stomp,' what comes next?"
        *   "Let's try a new one! Tap head, Tap knee, Tap head, Tap knee! What comes next?"
        *   "Can anyone show us their own body pattern?"
*   **Key Language:** "What comes after the clap?" "Repeat after me!" "It's a repeating pattern!"
*   **Tips for Success:** Keep the movements simple and clear. Use encouraging words. This is great for an energy break!
