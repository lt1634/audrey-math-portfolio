### Stage 4: Basic Addition/Subtraction with Objects (For Our Little Mathematicians!)

**Overall Aim:** To help our little ones explore the exciting world of numbers by putting things together and taking them away, using their hands and familiar objects! We'll discover how we get "more" or "less" through fun playtime.

#### Learning Goals: Discovering "More!" (Basic Addition with Objects)

Here's what our children will be exploring as they learn about adding!

1.  **Combining & Counting to Find "How Many Altogether!":**
    *   **Goal:** The child will be able to combine two small groups of familiar objects (e.g., their favourite toy cars, yummy pretend dim sum) and count the total number, up to a maximum of 5.
    *   **Let's Play Example:** "Look! We have **2** delicious siu mai here, and **1** more just arrived from the kitchen! Let's put them together. How many siu mai do we have **altogether** now? Count with me!" (Child points and counts '1, 2, 3!')
    *   **Why it's fun:** It's like a treasure hunt to find the total!

2.  **Spotting "More!":**
    *   **Goal:** The child will identify when a group has "more" objects after new items are added, using simple words like "more" or "bigger."
    *   **Let's Play Example:** "You have **3** colourful building blocks. I'm adding **1** more block. Do you have **more** blocks now, or less? Yes, **more**!" (Child points to the larger group)
    *   **Why it's fun:** They get to see their collection grow!

3.  **Showing "One More!":**
    *   **Goal:** The child will show "one more" using their fingers or small objects when prompted, understanding that adding just one makes the quantity bigger.
    *   **Let's Play Example:** "Show me **2** fingers. Now, add **one more** finger! How many do you see?" (Child shows 3 fingers)
    *   **Why it's fun:** Using their own hands makes learning super personal!

#### Learning Goals: Exploring "Less!" (Basic Subtraction with Objects)

Here's what our children will be exploring as they learn about taking things away!

1.  **Taking Away & Counting "What's Left!":**
    *   **Goal:** The child will be able to remove a specified number of objects (1 or 2) from a small group and count the remaining items, starting with a maximum of 5 objects.
    *   **Let's Play Example:** "We have **4** yummy fishballs on our stick. Uh oh, a little birdie flew by and took **1** fishball! How many fishballs are **left** for us to eat? Let's count!" (Child points and counts '1, 2, 3!')
    *   **Why it's fun:** It's like solving a little mystery â€“ what's still here?

2.  **Spotting "Less!":**
    *   **Goal:** The child will identify when a group has "less" objects after some items are taken away, using simple words like "less" or "smaller."
    *   **Let's Play Example:** "We had **5** bright red apples in our basket. Mommy took **2** apples to make juice. Do we have **more** apples now, or **less**? Yes, **less**!" (Child points to the smaller group)
    *   **Why it's fun:** They learn to notice changes in quantity!

3.  **Understanding "Taking Away" Through Action:**
    *   **Goal:** The child will understand the concept of "taking away" by physically removing objects from a set when asked.
    *   **Let's Play Example:** "Let's put **3** small MTR train toys on the track. Now, one train needs to go to the station for a rest! **Take one away**. How many trains are still on the track?"
    *   **Why it's fun:** They become the 'magic helper' who makes objects disappear and reappear!
