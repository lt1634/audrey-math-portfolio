*   **How we'll learn (hands-on fun!):**
    *   "Let's be shape detectives! Can you find round things like a yummy Hong Kong **egg tart**, a shiny coin, or the MTR sign? That's a **circle**!"
    *   "Now, look for things with four straight sides, like a building window, a picture frame, or a piece of yummy **turnip cake**! That's a **square**!"
    *   "And can you spot a shape with three sides, like the roof of a toy house, a piece of pizza, or a little party flag? That's a **triangle**!"
*   **Why it's fun:** We'll touch, point, and talk about shapes we see every day, making learning a game of 'I Spy'.

**Goal 2: Matching Shapes**
*   **What we'll do:** Children will be able to **match identical shapes**.
*   **How we'll learn (hands-on fun!):**
    *   "Time to find the twins! Can you match the round MTR token to the picture of the MTR logo? They're both **circles**!"
    *   "Let's put the square block into the square hole in our shape sorter toy. Find its perfect match!"
*   **Why it's fun:** We'll play with shape puzzles, sorting toys, and matching cards to pair up same-same shapes.

**Goal 3: Sorting Shapes**
*   **What we'll do:** Children will start to **sort objects by their shape**.
*   **How we'll learn (hands-on fun!):**
    *   "Let's tidy up! Can we put all the **square** blocks in the red basket and all the **round** balls in the blue basket?"
    *   "We can even sort our pretend dim sum – put all the half-moon shaped dumplings together!"
*   **Why it's fun:** We'll categorize toys, blocks, and everyday items into groups, making clean-up time a fun shape game!
