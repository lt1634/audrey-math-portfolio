# 🎯 Stage 1: Number Recognition and Counting (1-10)

## 🌟 Learning Goals & Objectives

G'day, little learners and grown-ups! As an early childhood educator here in vibrant Hong Kong, I'm thrilled to guide you through the exciting world of numbers for our wonderful 3-year-olds. We believe in learning through play, discovery, and lots of local flavour!

For our first big adventure in math, we'll focus on **Number Recognition and Counting (1-10)**. Our goal is to make numbers come alive, connecting them to familiar objects and experiences in our amazing city.

Here are the detailed learning goals for this stage, designed to be hands-on, fun, and easy for our children to grasp:

### Stage 1: Number Recognition and Counting (1-10) – Learning Goals

By the end of this stage, our little explorers will begin to:

1.  **Discover "One-by-One" (One-to-one Correspondence)**
    *   **Goal:** Understand that each object counted gets one unique number.
    *   **How we'll do it:** Children will learn to count items by touching each one as they say a number, understanding that each item gets "one" number.
    *   **Fun with HK:** "Let's count the yummy *fishballs* in our bowl – one, two, three! Or how many colourful *goldfish* are swimming in our tank? We'll count friends, toys, or even our fingers and toes!"

2.  **Spotting the Numbers (Numeral Recognition 1-10)**
    *   **Goal:** Recognize and name the written numerals from 1 to 10.
    *   **How we'll do it:** Children will begin to identify and say the names of the numbers 1 through 10 when they see them written down.
    *   **Fun with HK:** "Look! That's 'number 1' on the *double-decker bus*! Can you find 'number 5' on our pretend *MTR ticket*? We'll spot numbers on signs, storybooks, and even our name tags!"

3.  **Counting Small Treasures (Quantities 1-5)**
    *   **Goal:** Count up to five objects and correctly identify groups of 1-5 items.
    *   **How we'll do it:** Our little ones will be able to count up to five objects with accuracy and understand what those numbers "look like" in small groups.
    *   **Fun with HK:** "Can you find two *egg tarts* for your snack? Let's count three red *lai see packets*! We'll make towers with five blocks, or count four sparkly stickers for our artwork!"

4.  **Counting Bigger Collections (Quantities 6-10)**
    *   **Goal:** Count up to ten objects and correctly identify groups of 6-10 items.
    *   **How we'll do it:** We'll extend our counting skills to groups of up to ten objects, understanding that each number represents a specific quantity.
    *   **Fun with HK:** "How many delicious *siu mai* can we fit on this plate – can we count six? Let's count eight friends playing in the park! Can you help put away ten toy *chopsticks*?"

5.  **Numbers in Order! (Early Sequencing)**
    *   **Goal:** Begin to understand that numbers follow a specific sequence.
    *   **How we'll do it:** Children will start to grasp that numbers have a special order, like a number train!
    *   **Fun with HK:** "Let's put our number cards (1-5, then 1-10) in the correct line, just like carriages on the *MTR*! What comes after 3? What's before 5?"

6.  **Matching Fun! (Numeral to Quantity Association)**
    *   **Goal:** Connect a written numeral (1-10) with the corresponding quantity of objects.
    *   **How we'll do it:** Children will match a number card to a group of objects that represents that amount.
    *   **Fun with HK:** "Match the 'number 3' card to the plate with three *pineapple buns*! Find the box with 'number 7' and put seven happy faces inside!"

We'll use songs, stories, hands-on games, and plenty of positive encouragement to make learning numbers a joyous part of their day! Get ready for a mathematical adventure, Hong Kong style!
