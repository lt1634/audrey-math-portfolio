# Stage 6: Space and Problem Solving

## Learning Goals

Here are engaging, age-appropriate learning goals for 3-year-old children in a Hong Kong kindergarten, focusing on "Space and Problem Solving."

### **Learning Goals for 3-Year-Olds: Stage 6 - Space and Problem Solving**

**Overall Aim:** Our little learners will explore and understand basic spatial concepts, practice using words to describe where things are, and begin to solve simple spatial puzzles through fun, hands-on activities and everyday discoveries!

---

**1. Discovering Where Things Are (Position and Direction):**

*   **"I can tell if something is **inside** or **outside**!"**
    *   *Activity:* "Let's put our toy MTR train *inside* the box to keep it safe, then take it *outside* to ride on the mat!"
    *   *HK Connection:* Hiding a pretend dim sum bun *inside* a basket, then taking it *outside* to eat.

*   **"I can place things **on** or **under**!"**
    *   *Activity:* "Can you put your little animal friend *on* the big block? Now, let's hide it *under* the table!"
    *   *HK Connection:* Placing a bowl *on* the placemat, and the spoon *under* the napkin for our pretend meal.

*   **"I know **up** and **down**!"**
    *   *Activity:* "Reach *up* high like a tall skyscraper! Now, crouch *down* low like a little ladybug!"
    *   *HK Connection:* "Look, the ferry goes *up* and *down* with the waves in Victoria Harbour!"

*   **"I can find what's **in front** and **behind**!"**
    *   *Activity:* "When we line up, can you stand *in front of* your friend? Now, let's switch and stand *behind* them!"
    *   *HK Connection:* "The conductor stands *in front of* the MTR passengers, and the last passenger is *behind* everyone."

*   **"I can show if something is **near** or **far**!"**
    *   *Activity:* "Point to the toy that is *near* you. Now, point to the big window that is *far away*!"
    *   *HK Connection:* "Our school is *near* the park, but Disneyland is *far away*!"

*   **"I can put things **next to** each other!"**
    *   *Activity:* "Place your red block *next to* the blue block. They are friends!"
    *   *HK Connection:* "Put your chopsticks *next to* your bowl when we're ready to eat char siu!"

**2. Spotting Shapes All Around Us (Basic Shapes):**

*   **"I can spot things that are **round like a circle**!"**
    *   *Activity:* "Look, an egg tart is a circle! What else is a circle? (e.g., an MTR token, a wheel on a bus, a mooncake)."

*   **"I can find things that are **square**!"**
    *   *Activity:* "My building block is square! Can you find another square? (e.g., a biscuit, a small window, a mahjong tile)."

*   **"I can see things with **three straight sides like a triangle**!"**
    *   *Activity:* "A piece of yummy pizza is a triangle! And look, some traffic signs are triangles too!"
    *   *HK Connection:* The sails on some boats in the harbour can look like triangles!

*   **"I can point to things that are **long and squarish like a rectangle**!"**
    *   *Activity:* "Our school door is a rectangle! What else looks like a rectangle? (e.g., a book, a phone, a Hong Kong tram)."

*   **"I can match a shape!"**
    *   *Activity:* "I can put the circle block into the circle hole in the shape sorter! Hooray!"

---

**3. Solving Little Challenges (Simple Problem Solving):**

*   **"I can put together a simple puzzle!"**
    *   *Activity:* "I can connect 2 or 3 pieces to make a picture of a fun Hong Kong tram or a ferry!"

*   **"I can build with blocks!"**
    *   *Activity:* "I can make a tall tower like a Hong Kong skyscraper, or a little house for my toy people to live in."

*   **"I can follow simple spatial instructions!"**
    *   *Activity:* "Put the red car *on* the mat, then take the blue car *off* the mat. Good job!"

*   **"I can sort things by their shape or size!"**
    *   *Activity:* "Let's put all the round fruits together in one basket and all the square blocks in another! We're being tidy!"
